Sexagesimal calculator in a web browser.

From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagesimal

    Sexagesimal (base 60) is a numeral system with sixty as its base.  It
    originated with the ancient Sumerians in the 3rd millennium BC, it was
    passed down to the ancient Babylonians, and it is still used — in a
    modified form — for measuring time, angles, and geographic coordinates.
